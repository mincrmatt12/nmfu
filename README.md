`nmfu` attempts to turn a parser specified as a procedural matching thing into a state machine, parsing protocols with minimal memory and in arbitrarily sized chunks.

There are a number of examples present in the `examples/` folder, as well as documentation and a tutorial available on [readthedocs](https://nmfu.rtfd.io).

## Plugins

There is a vim plugin available which adds syntax highlighting for `.nmfu` files at [mincrmatt12/nmfu-vim](https://github.com/mincrmatt12/nmfu-vim), as well
as a pygments lexer plugin at [mincrmatt12/nmfu-pygments](https://github.com/mincrmatt12/nmfu-pygments).
